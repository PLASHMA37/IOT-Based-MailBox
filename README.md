Motivation:-
•	With the rise of e-commerce and frequent home deliveries, managing mail and package security has become more critical.
•	Many challenges persist, from missing deliveries to the rising concern of package theft.
•	The motivation behind this project is to create a seamless experience for managing mail and package deliveries while addressing growing concerns around convenience and security.

Implementation:-
The proposed Smart Mailbox is an IoT-enabled secure and automated delivery system designed to ensure safe mail handling and real-time monitoring.
-> A digital locking mechanism with an LCD screen, keypad, and servo motor provides controlled access to authorized users.
-> The system features Wi-Fi-enabled notifications via the ESP32 to alert the user about every event, including new deliveries and tampering attempts.
-> An IR motion sensor detects the opening of the mailbox lid. When it closes, the servo-controlled barrier temporarily opens to allow the letter or package to fall safely into a protected compartment, then            automatically closes to secure the contents. If tampering is detected, an instant alert notification is sent.
-> A load cell with a weight amplifier measures the delivered item’s weight, enabling the system to differentiate between letters and packages and send type-specific notifications to the user.
-> The design ensures secure, automated, and intelligent mail management with real-time Wi-Fi alerts and physical protection against unauthorized access.
